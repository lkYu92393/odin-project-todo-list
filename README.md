Odin Project is a website that teaches web programming, from html to javascript, including new framework like webpack and react. Its step-by-step tutorial is better than following W3Schools in my opinion.

## Aim

This project uses webpack to create a todo list website. It has the following functionality.
- Create a project
- Add todo to the project
- Remove todo from the project
- Remove the project
- Last through refresh (not implemented yet)

## How to reproduce on local

First, `git clone` the repo. Navigate to the folder. Run `npm install` to install the webpack utility.
Then run `npx webpack` to build the site.
